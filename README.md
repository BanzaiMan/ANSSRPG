ANSSRPG is an open source player progression framework built for Minecraft Forge and Cauldron servers. 
It (currently) features 3 skill archetypes that allow the players to gain experience through their actions.
Players are also able to obtain “perks” which allow them to unlock actions related to skills (in the future it will be expanded to provide user’s ability’s) 
Skills and perk's are user defined, so using this in a modpack is highly recommended
#I am always looking for help and feedback
I normally hangout on the #cauldron IRC on esper.net
